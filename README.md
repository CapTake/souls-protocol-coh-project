The Hero Souls Protocol is a set of smart contracts built on the Canto blockchain that allows users to create unique NFTs called "Souls." These Souls represent the core traits of a game character, such as Agility, Charisma, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Strength, and Wisdom, with each trait assigned a number of points by the user. Although the Souls themselves are immutable, their in-game incarnations can evolve and upgrade according to the rules of the game, with the traits of the Soul serving as the "factory defaults" for the in-game character.
